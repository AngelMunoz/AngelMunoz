### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my profile :) here you'll find a bunch of unfinished half-baked side projects (I'm pretty good at doing those)

I can do stuff in 

- Javascript/Typescript
- F#
- C#

and to a lesser extent :)

- Python
- Java

Yeah I know it's not useful but I don't have any idea what to put here anyways 😁
